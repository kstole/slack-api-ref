  "long_desc": "When a reaction is removed from an item the reaction_removed event is sent to all connected clients for users who can see the content that had the reaction. The user field indicates the ID of the user who performed this event. The item_user field represents the ID of the user that created the original item that has been reacted to. Some messages aren't authored by \"users,\" like those created by incoming webhooks. reaction_removed events related to these messages will not include an item_user. The item field is a brief reference to what the reaction was attached to. The above example describes a reaction being removed from a message.

The outer payload is uniform across all Events API methods, and contains fields like team_id and event. Learn more",
