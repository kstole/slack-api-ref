  "long_desc": "The member_joined_channel event is sent to all WebSocket connections and event subscriptions when users join all channel types including public and private channels, except direct messages between two users. For direct messages, there can only ever be two users, and members cannot be added. This even is also triggered upon creating a new channel. This example illustrates an absent inviter property, a result of a channel converting from public to private: This event is supported as a bot user subscription in the Events API. Workspace event subscriptions are also available for tokens holding at least one of the channels:read or groups:read scopes. Which events your app will receive depends on the scopes and their context. For instance, you'll only receive member_joined_channel events for private channels if your app has the groups:read permission. Even bot users receive this delightful event via Bot User subscription, when joining a channel. When an event occurs, we will send an HTTP POST request to your Request URL. The outer payload is uniform across all Events API methods, and contains fields like team_id and event. Learn more",
